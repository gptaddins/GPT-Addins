Usage Instructions
Assigning Multiple Users
Open an issue and locate the "Assignees" field. Start typing a user’s name, select from the auto-suggested list, and press Enter to add. Repeat to include additional team members. Save the issue to confirm assignments.

Viewing Assignees on Boards and Cards
Navigate to your project’s board view. Open a card to see all assignees listed as text (e.g., "John Doe, Jane Smith"). Check backlogs or work lists for the same clear display.

Aggregating Data for BI
Export issue data including the "Assignees" field via Jira’s CSV export option. Import into your BI tool (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) and analyze by grouping or filtering assignees.
